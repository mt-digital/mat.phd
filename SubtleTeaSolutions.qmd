# SubtleTea Solutions

**SubtleTea Solutions** is a boutique consultancy helping organizations design communication, coordination,
and change strategies using social science and technology.

### Communication and Social Science for High-Stakes Decisions {#sec-subtletea-subtitle}

We work where miscommunication is expensive and trial-and-error is too slow:
marketing and influence campaigns, organizational change, and public-facing
initiatives. Our focus is on how language and framing interact with real social
systems—how messages spread, how they are interpreted across groups, and how
they can unintentionally force polarization.

Much of what makes communication fail is already known. Social science has
identified how language activates identities, shapes interpretation, and hardens
positions—even without intent, and especially when used deliberately. SubtleTea
Solutions uses this knowledge to eliminate fragile messaging upfront. When
testing is useful, it is done deliberately, to refine already-stable
communication rather than to discover fundamentals.


## Communication

SubtleTea **Communication** supports organizations in developing messages that
remain effective across audiences and resilient to misinterpretation.

Engagements typically involve:

- diagnosing how existing language lands with audiences,
- sharpening narratives and metaphors to promote organizational goals
- tuning high-stakes, subtle communication where failure would be costly.

This work emphasizes structural clarity based on social and cognitive science principles. Testing,
when appropriate, is principled and targeted.


## Research

SubtleTea **Research** provides the conceptual, analytical, and methodological
backbone for SubtleTea Solutions work. This includes longer-horizon research,
internal tooling, and selective collaborations at the intersection of social
science, technology, and sustainability.


## Intelligence & Education

SubtleTea **Intelligence** and **Education** offerings translate research into
decision support, custom analyses, and instruction that help organizations build
their own strategic capacity.


## Engagements

SubtleTea Solutions works on a limited number of high-trust engagements at a
time. Pricing reflects the strategic, reputational, and organizational stakes of
the work.
