### Reducing uncertainty in high-stakes decisions

![](images/cafecito-pic.png){.float-left width="170px"} 

**I help organizations reduce uncertainty** when designing
campaigns and programs that aim to shape behavior and beliefs. I work in
partnership with clients who know how risky it feels to commit limited resources
to high-stakes outreach, building confidence by testing and comparing strategies
through scientific modeling before spending a dime. Drawing on broad
computational experience, I also support execution and coordinate with technical
vendors so good strategy survives contact with reality.
