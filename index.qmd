### Social science research and communication for real-world decisions


![](images/cafecito-pic.png){.float-left width="170px"} 

**I am an independent researcher and educator developing communication and
computational tools for sustainable, democratic, and profitable social
organization.** 

My company, [SubtleTea Solutions](SubtleTeaSolutions.qmd), 
helps clients and partners hone their
communication strategies for marketing and influence campaigns by
using social and cognitive science models of social behavior. 

In addition to SubtleTea Solutions, I serve as co-Director of [Projeto
Dourados](https://projeto-dourados.org), a program to promote Indigenous health in the
Americas by bringing together researchers from Brazil and the United States
and consolidating epidemiology and social science approaches.

Please see my Substack publication, [The Social Science Intelligence
Report](https://ssir.substack.com) for my hottest new thinking in the form of
essays, articles, and sometimes videos. I also 

My [CV](turner_cv.pdf) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mt-digital/)
have summaries of my research articles, tutorials, and other research products
from my academic career. I post and discuss various topics on LinkedIn as well. 
For an example of my web development work, I developed this website and the 
Projeto Dourados website, [https://projeto-dourados.org](https://projeto-dourados.org).
