    "text": "Reducing uncertainty in high-stakes decisions\n\nI help organizations reduce uncertainty when designing campaigns and programs that aim to shape behavior and beliefs. I work in partnership with clients who know how risky it feels to commit limited resources to high-stakes outreach, building confidence by testing and comparing strategies through scientific modeling before spending a dime. Drawing on broad computational experience, I also support execution and coordinate with technical vendors so good strategy survives contact with reality.\n\nThis site outlines my work in applied decision support, research, and education, and connects to SubtleTea Solutions, where I develop and deliver related products and services. My work brings research-grade rigor to real decision environments."

    "text": "I founded SubtleTea Solutions, LLC to help organizations—large and small—plan social change campaigns with greater clarity and confidence, especially when the costs of getting it wrong are high. We support decisions about how messages, products, and practices spread through social networks, both in person and online. When useful, we also help our clients choose and apply the right computational tools for the problem at hand. Sometimes that means advanced modeling or AI; other times, carefully structured analysis in Excel is far more effective.\nSubtleTea Solutions provides multi-tiered services to develop social science intelligence for organizations. Engagements begin with a focused consultation to understand client needs and aspirations. Our ideal clients are those we can grow with: we aim to deliver immediate insight while creating the conditions for strategies to evolve through continuous feedback about what works, what doesn’t, and why."
